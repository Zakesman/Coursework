# Coursework
Code from various courses that I have done.
The Deep Learning course is by Prof Andrew Ng of Stanford University. The course is taught through Coursera and is called Deep Learning.ai. Note that the Deep learning code from the course is not structured in this repo as it is in the course and is not in Jupyter Notebooks. That is because I worked through the source code line-by-line rewriting it in an IDE instead of completing only the portions required for the course. I found it easier to do this in an IDE than in a Jupyter Notebook. 

The Data Science course is by Frank Kane of Sundog Education who previously worked at Amazon and IMDb. The course is taught on Udemy and is called Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python.
