Remember this is the relative error between the predicted rating for a movie and the actual (average) rating that it was given. Since this value of K that minimises the relative error is not the same from one movie to another, we need to find the relative error that we can reliably use for any given movie in the set and we can be comfortable that it will be suitable for minimising the relative error.
